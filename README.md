# Instagram_API_Task03

This project features a `RESTful API` named `Instagram API`, designed to replicate essential functionalities of a social media platform. It is built using `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `MongoDB`, showcasing modular development for managing Users, Posts, Comments, Followers, and Stories.

The API supports:

`User management` (registration, updates, and deletion).
`CRUD operations` for posts and comments.
`Following/unfollowing` users.
`Story creation and expiration handling`.
This project is ideal for understanding modern backend API design and development practices.
